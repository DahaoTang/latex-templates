# Dahao's Latex Template

This repo serves as the template for LaTeX-based projects, e.g., slides, posters, etc.

The current templates include:

```
./slides/ 		# templates for slides
├── casual		# a deep-blue colour theme template
└── usyd		# a USYD-inspired colour theme template
```

## How to use

For **_Slides_**:

To build:

1. Just stay at the root directory (or actually no matter where you are).
2. Modify the `slides.tex` file.
3. Save it -- it will automatically be built. Only the `slides.pdf` will be kept after the build -- all the other files will be removed.
